How to build
------------

1. Install dependencies

The dependencies of any Debian project are listed in the "Build-Depends" section
of the file named "control" in the "debian" subdirectory of the project. Either 
install each of these manually by using "sudo apt install <dependency-name>", or,
if the project has already been released into apt, the build dependencies can all
be automatically installed using the command "sudo apt build-dep <package-name>".

2. Configure meson

To configure the meson build system, use the command "meson setup builddir"
in the top directory of the project. This will create a subdirectory "builddir",
and by default set the project for installation in the /usr/local tree,
which will not overwrite a version which has been installed from apt.

If you wish to overwrite a preinstalled version in the /usr tree, use the command
"meson setup builddir --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib/<library-location>".
On a 32-bit system, <library-location> should be "arm-linux-gnueabihf".
On a 64-bit system, <library-location> should be "aarch64-linux-gnu".

3. Build

To build the application, change to the "builddir" directory and use the
command "meson compile".

4. Install

To install the application and all required data files, change to the
"builddir" directory and use the command "sudo meson install".
